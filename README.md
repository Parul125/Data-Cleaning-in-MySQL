Project Description:
This project focuses on implementing data cleaning techniques in MySQL to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of a database. Data cleaning is an essential step in data preprocessing, especially for maintaining high-quality datasets in business intelligence, analytics, and machine learning applications.

Objectives:
Identify and remove duplicate records.
Handle missing or NULL values.
Standardize and format data (e.g., correcting date formats, string capitalization, removing extra spaces).
Detect and correct inconsistencies in data (e.g., incorrect spellings, incorrect categorizations).
Remove irrelevant or outdated records.
Project Scope:
Data Inspection:

Analyzing the dataset for inconsistencies and errors.
Checking for missing values and duplicates.
Data Cleaning Techniques:

Using SQL queries for duplicate removal (DELETE, DISTINCT).
Handling NULL values by replacement or deletion (COALESCE, IFNULL).
Applying string functions for standardization (TRIM, LOWER, UPPER).
Correcting inconsistent values using JOINs and CASE statements.
Formatting date fields using STR_TO_DATE and DATE_FORMAT.
Validation & Optimization:

Ensuring referential integrity with constraints and foreign keys.
Optimizing queries for better performance.
Technologies Used:
MySQL for data processing.
SQL queries for data transformation and cleaning.
Expected Outcome:
A cleaned and structured dataset that is error-free, standardized, and optimized for analysis.
Improved data quality for decision-making and reporting.
This project is crucial for any data-driven organization looking to improve data integrity, usability, and performance in their databases. ðŸš€
